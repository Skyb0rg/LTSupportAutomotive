# Introduction #

**LTSupportAutomotive** is a library for writing apps that communicate with vehicles using **OBD2** adapters. It also contains auxilliary classes, such as a *VIN decoder*, and a *BTLE characteristic(s) / `NSStream`* serial bridge.

Here is an overview of the most important classes:

### `LTOBD2Adapter` (abstract) ###

Represents an OBD2 adapter sending commands over input- and output-streams using a certain vehicle protocol. Concrete subclasses (e.g., `LBOBD2AdapterELM327` for ELM327-compatible chipsets, or `LTOBD2AdapterCaptureFile` for capture files) are available.

### `LTOBD2Command` (abstract) ###

Represents an OBD2 command. Concrete subclasses, e.g. for the well-known OBD2 PIDs are available.

### `LTOBD2Protocol` (abstract) ###

Represents a generic vehicle protocol. Concrete subclasses for protocols such as ISO14230-4 (CAN), ISO15765-4, ISO9141-2, or SAEJ1850 are available.

### `LTBTLESerialTransporter` ###

Represents a bridge between one or two BTLE characteristics and NSStream subclasses.

# How to use LTSupportAutomotive #

### CococaPods ###

Add this framework to your podfile:
```
pod 'LTSupportAutomotive', '~> 1.0'
```

### Carthage ###

If anyone wants to make this *carthage* aware, feel free to supply a pull request. I'm not using this package manager myself.

### Xcode subproject ###

You can also include LTSupportAutomotive as an Xcode subproject and link `LTSupportAutomotive.framework` to your executable.

# Examples #

`LTAutomotiveSupportDemo.xcodeproj` is a (pretty bare-bones) example project.

# Apps using this library #

Please drop us a note, if you are using this library as well.

# Supported Hardware #

This software should work with most ELM327-compatible hardware (including the behemoth of available *clones*). In general, I recommend the Bluetooth 4.0 devices, since they seems to have a much better quality compared to the WiFi adapters.
Moreover, they're much more convenient as you don't have to switch the WiFi network. Note that since iOS is lacking public SDK access to *Bluetooth classic* (in particular the Bluetooth `rfcomm` protocol), iOS devices will **not** work with Bluetooth 3.0 adapters.

I have tested this library myself with the following adapters (Note that none of these contain a *real* ELM327):

### BTLE (aka BLE, BluetoothSmart, or BT 4.0) ###
* Carista Bluetooth OBD2
* FIXD OBD-II Scan Tool (2nd Gen)
* LELink Bluetooth Low Energy
* VGate iCar Pro BLE4.0 Dual

### WiFi ###
* NAVISKAUTO WIFI WLAN ELM327
* EXZAÂ® SUPER Mini WiFi WLAN OBD 2
* OBDLINK MX (w/ STN11xx)

### USB ###
* OBDLINK SX SCANTOOL

# Enhancements #

While this library can already be used for a lot of things, I'd like to see improvements in a bunch of areas, such as:

* Translations (I only have DE, FR, and EN atm.),
* Implementation of missing standardized PIDs,
* Addition of vendor-specific DTCs,
* Implementation of vendor-specific PIDs,
* Implementation of *direct* (non-PID-based) communication with ECUs.

# How to contribute #

Please fork and open a pull-request. I'd also like to know about success stories or confirmation for additional compatible hardware (see above) working with this library.
